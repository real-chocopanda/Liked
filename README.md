# Liked

Adds the facebook like feature to the top of every dicussion.

Seems to require 2.0.16 or later

Also includes meta data facebook uses.

Currently contains a small amount of inline css to position it next to the meta information, didn't seem sense to include a whole new css file for 1 line, however can be changed if people require it for theming.

## Installation
